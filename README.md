## Resources provided:
In this open source project, we provide the necessary resources required for the experiment:
- **Data folder**: Contains the data files required to perform the experiment
- **Graph folder**: This folder contains the process of generating dynamic and static composite graphs according to the paper.
- **Weight folder**: Contains the implementation source code for calculating the centrality of nodes using the PageRank algorithm.
- **Suspicious folder**: Contains the method we use to calculate the suspicion of each statement.
- **Evaluate folder**: Contains the code for implementing the benchmark and the calculation and output of the results.
These resources are provided for easy reference and repetitive experimental process. Developers can clone the code repository to obtain the code and data required for defect location using our method. Experiment.
